In this quick tutorial, we'll go through the example of an AI chatbot company called Summer Chat setting up pricing ðŸ˜‰. Summer Chat wants to allow 20 premium messages and 50 normal messages per month on their Pro plan.

## Step 1: Set up feature tracking / gating
First, let's create a feature in the dashboard. We'll create one called 'Premium Msg' and one for 'Normal Msg'. Additionally, these will be 'Metered' features since they are countable.

## Step 2: Create a product
Next, let's create a product. We'll call it "Pro", and under Entitlements, we'll add our 20 premium messages / month and 50 normal messages / month. We'll then add a pricing of $20 / month

## Step 3: Create a customer
Finally, let's create our first customer. You can do this either via the API or dashboard. The best part...you can use your own customer IDs!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API">
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.useautumn.com/v1/customers', {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: JSON.stringify({
        "id": "my_personal_id",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@gmail.com"
      })
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <img
      src="/assets/screenshots/create_customer.png"
      width={700}
      alt="Hero Dark"
    />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Attach a product
Next, let's attach our Pro product to the customer. Once again, you can do this via Dashboard or API. This step will involve billing the customer, so if you haven't set up your Stripe credentials yet, you will be prompted to do so.

Our design philosiphy is that you should not have to handle upgrades, downgrades, webhooks, and more. As such, whenever you want to attach a product to a customer, all you need to do is call this endpoint, and we will handle all the logic for you!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API">
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.useautumn.com/v1/attach', {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: JSON.stringify({
        "customer_id": "my_personal_id",
        "product_id": "prod_2rwydCAcuUp913PqoZwOjpy4aDM"
      })
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <img
      src="/assets/screenshots/attach_product.png"
      width={700}
      alt="Hero Dark"
    />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Step 5: Check access and send event

Now, whenever a customer uses one of your features, all you need to do is first check if the customer has access to it, then send an event if so!

```javascript
// 1. Check if customer is entitled to feature
const response = await fetch('https://api.useautumn.com/v1/entitled', {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "customer_id": "my_personal_id",
    "feature_id": "premium_msg"
  })
})

// 2. Check if user is allowed
let data = await response.json()
if (!data.allowed) {
  throw new Error(`feature not allowed`)
}

// 3. Send event if user accesses feature
await fetch('https://api.useautumn.com/v1/events', {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "customer_id": "my_personal_id",
    "event_name": "premium_msg"
  })
})
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
