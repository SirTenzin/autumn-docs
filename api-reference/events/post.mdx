This endpoint is for sending usage events to Autumn, required for tracking your metered features. Events can aggregated via:

- `COUNT`: Counts the number of times an event happened (eg. number of users created).
- `SUM`: Sums a value sent in the event properties (eg. total compute time)
<Tip> Autumn will automatically create a new customer if the `customer_id` doesn't already exist.  You can optionally set the properties of this new customer through the `customer_data` field.</Tip>
