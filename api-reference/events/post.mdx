title: 'Send Usage Event'
openapi: 'POST /events'
---
This endpoint is for sending usage events to Autumn, required for tracking your metered features. Events can aggregated via:

- `COUNT`: Counts the number of times an event happened (eg. number of users created).
- `SUM`: Sums a value sent in the event properties (eg. total compute time)
<Tip> If the `customer_id` you send doesn't already exist, Autumn will automatically create a new customer and assign any default products.  
You can optionally set the properties of this new customer through the `customer_data` field.</Tip>
