If payment is required, a Stripe `checkout_url` will be returned. If the customer's card is already on file, any upgrade or downgrade logic will be handled, and a `success: true` response will be returned.

<Tip> Autumn will automatically create a new customer if the `customer_id` doesn't already exist.  You can optionally set the properties of this new customer through the `customer_data` field.</Tip>
