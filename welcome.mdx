## Autumn vs Stripe

When integrating Stripe directly, you have to listen to a number of payment webhook events, and synchronize that with an internal database that controls what your users get access to. This is tricky to setup and harder to maintain as you scale and update your pricing.

Autumn acts as that database: a source of truth for your pricing plans, subscription states, feature permissions and usage metering.

Autumn is used by developers, founders and fast-growing startups because it's easier, more reliable, and more scalable than building pricing yourself.

1. **Fastest setup** - Run your app's pricing model with 3 functions.
2. **No webhooks required** - Autumn handles all of Stripe's webhooks, so you don't deal with race conditions and edge cases. Most users don't need webhooks.
3. **Enforce access limits** - Autumn knows who's paying for which product and what features they have access to. Just [check](/features/check.mdx) if a customer has access, then [track](/features/tracking-usage.mdx) any usage.
4. **Billing flows and logic** - No need to build separate backend and frontend flows for upgrades, downgrades and failed payments.
5. **UI components** - Pricing tables, purchase confirmation dialogs and paywalls. Drop-in our react components, or download them as shadcn/ui files to customize.
6. **Make pricing changes without code** - Growing companies always change pricing, even at the largest scales. Make pricing changes, set custom plans, and handle migrations/versioning through our UI.

## How it works

<Steps>
<Step title="Model your pricing">
Model your pricing plans in the Autumn UI, or through a config file. Define your free, paid and any add-on pricing tiers. Most common AI and SaaS pricing is supported.
</Step>
<Step title="Handle payments">
The `checkout` function will return a Stripe checkout URL, or upgrade/downgrade data if they're already on a plan.

Once paid, the Autumn will grant access to any features you defined in step 1.

</Step>

<Step title="Check product or feature access">
[Check](/features/check) in real-time whether a customer has access to a product (eg Pro plan), or a feature (eg, credits, SSO).

</Step>

<Step title="Track usage">
If Autumn tells you they're `allowed` access, you can [track their usage](/features/tracking-usage) to update their balance, or bill them for any usage-pricing.

</Step>
</Steps>

Autumn also provides APIs to easily get customer billing data (to display on a billing page), open Stripe billing portal, display usage analytics, handle org billing, setup referral programs and more.

## What Autumn isn't

- A Stripe billing replacement: although you don't need to deal with Stripe's APIs, you are still using (and paying for) Stripe's subscriptions, payments and invoicing.
- Another metered billing product: Autumn easily handles usage-based billing up to 1000 events per second, but there are many providers out there that specialize if you need more. Autumn excels at making it easy to deal with the logic and complexities of AI/SaaS pricing.
- For purely sales-led companies: Autumn is designed to be used by product-led, or hybrid product-sales teams. If your customers only pay via custom invoices, Autumn is probably not for you.
