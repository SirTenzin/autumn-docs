description: "Automatically create customers in Autumn when a user signs up with our Next.js authentication plugins"
---

Autumn provides authentication plugins that make it easy to integrate with popular auth providers. Instead of manually finding and passing customer IDs, you can use our auth plugins to automatically sync the customer information.

## Configuration Options

The auth plugin configuration accepts the following fields:

- `provider`: The authentication provider to use ("better-auth", "supabase", or "clerk")
- `instance`: For better-auth, your server-side auth instance
- `useOrg`: Set to `true` if you want to use organizations as Autumn customers instead of individual users

This config is passed to the [`<AutumnProvider />` component](/quickstart/nextjs#3-set-up-%3Cautumnprovider%3E) that wraps your Next.js application.

<Note>
  If you're using an Auth Plugin, then you don't need to pass the `customerId`
  prop into AutumnProvider, as we'll get this automatically from the auth
  provider.
</Note>

## Providers

#### Better-Auth

For Better Auth integration, first import your auth instance:

```tsx
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

<AutumnProvider
  authPlugin={{
    provider: "better-auth",
    instance: auth, // Your server-side better-auth instance
    useOrg: true, // Set to true if organizations are your customers
  }}
  //optional: pass customer data to Autumn
  customerData={{
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@doe.com",
  }}
>
  {children}
</AutumnProvider>;
```

#### Supabase Auth

```tsx
<AutumnProvider
  authPlugin={{
    provider: "supabase",
  }}
  //optional: pass customer data to Autumn
  customerData={{
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@doe.com",
  }}
>
  {children}
</AutumnProvider>
```

<Note>
  Supabase does not support organizations, so `useOrg` is not supported for
  Supabase.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Make sure you're using the default variable names in your .env.local file:
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
</Warning>

#### Clerk

```tsx
<AutumnProvider
  authPlugin={{
    provider: "clerk",
    useOrg: true, // Set to true if organizations are your customers
  }}
  //optional: pass customer data to Autumn
  customerData={{
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@doe.com",
  }}
>
  {children}
</AutumnProvider>
```

<Warning>
  Make sure you're using the default variable names in your .env.local file:
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.
</Warning>
