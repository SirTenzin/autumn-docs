The customer details page provides a comprehensive view of a customer's information, subscriptions, and usage. You can access this by clicking on any customer from the [Customers page](https://app.useautumn.com/customers).

The customer details page shows:

- **Products**: View active subscriptions, status, billing dates, and feature limits
- **Features**: Track usage, limits, reset dates and history graphs
- **Invoices**: See billing history, payment status, amounts and hosted invoice pages
- **Events**: View feature usage events that have been tracked for the customer

## Enabling a Product

You can enable a product for a customer either via the API using the `attach` method or via the dashboard.

<Card
  title="Attaching Products"
  icon="link"
  href="/products/enabling-product"
  horizontal
/>

If you're enabling a product for a customer that already has a product, Autumn will handle the upgrade or downgrade between the two products.

#### Custom Product Versions

When attaching a product via the Dashboard, you can optionally make changes to the product items before enabling it. This will create a custom version of the product.

When enabling a custom product, what happens will depend on the changes you made:

- **Changing features only**: this will take effect immediately, provisioning the new features while keeping the same reset dates
- **Changing pricing**: this will follow Autumn's [upgrade and downgrade logic](/products/enabling-product#upgrades-and-downgrades), depending on whether the pricing is higher or lower than the existing product

## Editing Feature Balances

You can directly edit a customer's feature balances via the dashboard, to give them additional allowance or alter how much they'll be charged for their next invoice (typically in case of errors).

1. Navigate to the Customer details page
2. Under "Available Features", click on the feature you want to edit the balance for.
3. In the popup, enter the new balance value:
   - If you're giving them more allowance (`included_usage`) of a feature, enter a **positive** number
   - If you're changing how much usage they'll be charged for, enter a **negative** number
4. Optionally, set a new [usage reset date](/products/product-items#metered-features) for the feature
5. Click "Update"

<Note>
  Editing a balance will only last until the next reset date of the feature. If
  you want to permanently set a new allowance, you should create a custom
  product with the new allowance.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you want to give a customer access to a feature that isn't present in the
  product they're on, you can create a custom product with the new feature.
</Tip>

## Adding a Coupon

To apply a discount to a customer:

1. Go to the customer's details page
2. Under the "Rewards" section of the sidebar, click "Add Coupon"
3. Select a reward from the available options
4. Click "Add Reward"

The discount will show up when a Checkout URL is generated for the customer via `attach`, or from their next invoice.

## Updating Customer Properties

You can update a customer's basic information through either the dashboard or API:

#### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to the customer's details page
2. On the right-hand side, you'll see a "Details" section in the sidebar. Click on any of the fields.
3. Update the desired fields (name, email, etc.)
4. Click "Update"

#### Via API

You can also update a customer's properties via the API, useful for when a customer changes their details in your application.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl -X PUT https://api.useautumn.com/customers/{customer_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Mr New Name", 
    "email": "newemail@example.com", 
    "fingerprint": "new-device-id"
    }'
```

```javascript TypeScript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

await autumn.customers.update({
  id: "customer_id",
  name: "Mr New Name",
  email: "newemail@example.com",
  fingerprint: "new-device-id",
});
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from autumn import Autumn

autumn = Autumn('secret_key')

async def main():
    await autumn.customers.update(
        id="customer_id".
        name="Mr New Name",
        email="newemail@example.com",
        fingerprint="new-device-id"
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Deleting a Customer

To delete a customer:

1. Go to the customer's details page
2. Click the "Settings" icon in the top right
3. Click "Delete"

<Warning>
  Deleting a customer will not delete it in Stripe. If they have existing
  subscriptions, you should cancel them from Stripe if needed.
</Warning>
