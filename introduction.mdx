Autumn decouples pricing and billing logic from your codebase. Think of it like your external database that bills your users and tracks what they should get access to.

## Why use Autumn?

Autumn is easy to integate and you never have to deal with billing again.

1. **Dead simple integration** - Just 2 API calls to set up any pricing model. No webhooks, state syncing or server management needed.
2. **Manages feature access** - Autumn knows who has access to what and enforces limits. Just call our [/entitled](/api-reference/entitled) endpoint and we'll tell you if they have access.
3. **Make pricing changes at any time** - make pricing changes or launch new types of pricing without going through engineering. Subscriptions, usage-based, credits -- we take care of it for you.
4. **Reliable billing without maintenance** - we handle all the edge cases (ie, Stripe's [258 webhook statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types))

## Concepts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Features">
  Features are the parts of your application you want to charge for, and the building blocks of your products. They can be:

- **Boolean**: something a customer either has access to or not (eg, SSO auth).
- **Metered**: something a customer can use up (eg, AI credits).

When you define a feature in Autumn, you'll set its `feature_id`, which you'll use from your codebase to check if a user has access to it. If it's metered, you'll also set an `event_name`, which you'll use to send usage events.

You can also define a credit system, for when you want to have features draw from a balance.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Products">
  Products are how you charge your users and what they get access to. They're made up of:
    - **Entitlements** - what features your users get access to if they pay for a product.
    - **Pricing** - how you charge your users (subscriptions, monthly vs annual, usage-based, credits, add-ons etc)

Your users will pay for these products. Using the [/attach](/api-reference/attach/) endpoint will return a Stripe Checkout URL, and once the payment is complete, we'll grant the user access to the product's entitlements.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Entitlements">
  Entitlements define exactly what the user gets access to when they pay for a product. You'll check if a user has access to an entitlement by calling the [/entitled](/api-reference/entitled/) endpoint.

They are made up of features.

| Feature       | Entitlement                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Chat Messages | 100 Chat Messages per month with Pro tier |
| Pro Analytics | Access to Pro Analytics with Pro tier     |

  </Tab>
