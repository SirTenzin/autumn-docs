Autumn decouples pricing and billing logic from your codebase. It's an external layer over Stripe that tracks what your customers get access to, enforces any limits you set, and bills them for it.

## Why use Autumn?

Autumn is loved by hackers, founders and fast-growing startups because it's easy to integrate and **billing never has to be touched again**.

1. **Dead simple integration** - Just 2 API calls to set up any pricing model. No webhooks, state syncing or server management needed.
2. **Managed feature access** - Autumn knows who has access to what and enforces limits. Just call our [/entitled](/api-reference/entitled) endpoint and we'll tell you if they have access.
3. **Billing flows handled** - Upgrades, downgrades, failed payments, and more. Autumn handles all the edge cases so you don't have to.
4. **Make pricing changes at any time** - Make pricing changes, set custom plans, or launch new types of pricing without going through engineering. Versioning, grandfathering and migrations becomes easy.

{/* ## Concepts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Features">
  Features are the parts of your application you want to charge for, and the building blocks of your products. They can be:

- **Boolean**: something a customer either has access to or not (eg, SSO auth).
- **Metered**: something a customer can use up (eg, AI credits).

When you define a feature in Autumn, you'll set its `feature_id`, which you'll use from your codebase to check if a user has access to it. If it's metered, you'll also set an `event_name`, which you'll use to send usage events.

You can also define a credit system, for when you want to have features draw from a balance.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Products">
  Products are how you charge your users and what they get access to. They're made up of:
    - **Entitlements** - what features your users get access to if they pay for a product.
    - **Pricing** - how you charge your users (subscriptions, monthly vs annual, usage-based, credits, add-ons etc)

Your users will pay for these products. Using the [/attach](/api-reference/attach/) endpoint will return a Stripe Checkout URL, and once the payment is complete, we'll grant the user access to the product's entitlements.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Entitlements">
  Entitlements define exactly what the user gets access to when they pay for a product. You'll check if a user has access to an entitlement by calling the [/entitled](/api-reference/entitled/) endpoint.

They are made up of features.

| Feature       | Entitlement                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Chat Messages | 100 Chat Messages per month with Pro tier |
| Pro Analytics | Access to Pro Analytics with Pro tier     |

  </Tab>
