Autumn is your application's pricing and billing engine. It tracks what your customers get access to, enforces those access limits for each customer, and connects it all seamlessly to Stripe.

## Why use Autumn?

Autumn is loved by developers, founders and fast-growing startups because it's easy to integrate and **billing never has to be touched again**.

1. **The most simple integration available** - Just 2 API calls to set up any pricing model. You don't need to deal with webhooks, state syncing, or deal with any of Stripe's APIs.
2. **Enforce access limits** - Autumn knows who's paying for which product and what features they have access to. Just [check](/features/check.mdx) if a customer has access, then [track](/features/tracking-usage.mdx) any usage if needed.
3. **Billing flows handled** - Upgrades, downgrades, failed payments, and more. Autumn takes care of it all, with customizable UI components that "just work" out of the box.
4. **Make changes without touching code** - Make pricing changes, set custom plans, or launch new types of pricing without going through engineering. Versioning, grandfathering and migrations is easy through the Autumn dashboard.

## What Autumn isn't

- A Stripe billing replacement: although you don't need to deal with Stripe's APIs, you are still using Stripe's subscriptions, payments and invoicing.
- Another metered billing product: Autumn easily handles usage-based billing up to 100 events per second, but there are many providers out there that specialize if you need more.
- For purely sales-led companies: Autumn is designed to be used by product-led, or hybrid product-sales teams. If your customers only pay via custom invoices, Autumn is probably not for you.
