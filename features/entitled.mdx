description: "Learn how to check feature access with the `entitled` route"
---

When you create a product in Autumn, you define what features your customers on that product get access to.

The `entitled` method returns the `allowed` property to check if a customer should have access to a feature, so you can block access or prompt them to upgrade.

## Checking Metered Features

Before your customer uses a feature, you can check if the customer is allowed to use it and their current usage.

<Info>
**Example Use Case:**

Let's imagine you have a free product that allows 100 AI messages per month. Before your customer sends an AI message, you can check if they have any remaining messages.

If they still have messages remaining, they'll be allowed to send an AI message. You can then [record the usage event](/features/recording-usage/) so Autumn can keep track of the balance.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/entitled" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user-123",
    "feature_id": "ai-messages",
  }'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.entitled({
  customerId: "user-123",
  featureId: "ai-messages",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "balances": [
    {
      "feature_id": "ai-messages",
      "balance": 100,
      "required": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
Even if your product doesn't have usage limits (ie your product is purely usage-based), you can still use the above method to prevent excessive usage if a customer's payment fails.

If the [product status](/products/enabling-product/#product-statuses) is `past_due`, by default, Autumn will block access to the feature.

</Tip>

#### Checking for a Required Quantity

If you know the quantity a user will consume in advance, you can specify it with the `required_quantity` parameter. This means you can prevent a user from starting a process that would consume more than their allowance.

By default, `required_quantity` is 1, so not passing this parameter will return `allowed: true` as long as the customer has a feature balance of 1 or more.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL {7}
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/entitled" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user-123",
    "feature_id": "ai-messages",
    "required_quantity": 3
  }'
```

```javascript Typescript {10}
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.entitled({
  customerId: "user-123",
  featureId: "ai-messages",
  requiredQuantity: 3,
});
```

#### Checking Feature Access and Recording Usage together

In a typical workflow, you'll want to check if a customer has access to a feature and then [record the usage](/features/recording-usage/) as separate steps.

However, you can check entitlement and record usage in a single API call using the `send_event` field. The usage value will be the `required_quantity` parameter.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL {7-8}
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/entitled" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user-123",
    "feature_id": "ai-messages",
    "required_quantity": 3,
    "send_event": true
  }'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.entitled({
  customer_id: "user-123",
  feature_id: "api_calls",
  required_quantity: 3,
  send_event: true,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  We recommend doing these as separate steps in your application logic, so usage is only counted if the event is successful.

Alternatively, you can "refund" usage with a negative usage `value` if the event fails.

</Warning>
## Checking Boolean Features

For simple on/off features, use the endpoint to determine if a customer has access.

You can do this on the client side on page load, using a `useEffect` function:

```javascript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.entitled({
  customer_id: "user-123",
  feature_id: "premium-dashboard",
});
```

```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "balances": [
    {
      "feature_id": "premium-dashboard",
      "balance": null,
      "required": null
    }
  ]
}
```

{/* ## Creating New Customers

If the `customer_id` you provide doesn't exist yet, Autumn will automatically create a new customer:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.useautumn.com/v1/entitled", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${AUTUMN_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    customer_id: "new-user-456",
    feature_id: "basic_access",
    customer_data: {
      email: "user@example.com",
      name: "New User",
    },
  }),
});
```

The `customer_data` object lets you provide additional properties for the new customer. \*/}
