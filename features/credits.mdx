{/* Creating credits, how it works with entitlements, that you should use the features not credits. monetary credits. */}

Credit systems allow you to track and limit the usage of multiple different features from a shared balance. This can simplift billing when you have many different usage-based features, and they all cost different amounts.

## Creating a credit system

<Warning>
  Make sure you have some metered features created before creating a credit
  system.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to the products page
2. Click the "Features" tab
3. Click "+ Credit System"
4. Add each metered feature you want to affect the credit system.
5. For each feature, define how many credits each unit of usage (ie, the `value` field in the `track` route) should be worth.
6. Click "Create"

<Info>
**Example**

If each `audio-transcription-minute` is worth 3 credits, then using 6 minutes of audio transcription will cost 18 credits.

</Info>

Now you can add these credits as a [product item](/products/product-items.mdx) within a product. Such as 50 credits per month or $1 per credit.

## Using credits via the API

When implementing a credit system into your application, you should interact with the underlying features (not the credit system itself).

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user-123",
    "feature_id": "audio-transcription-minutes",
  }'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.check({
  customer_id: "user-123",
  feature_id: "audio-transcription-minutes",
});
```

</CodeGroup>
The response will contain the ID of the credit system you defined.

```json {8}
{
  "customer_id": "john-mcyeo",
  "feature_id": "small-model-tokens",
  "code": "feature_found",
  "allowed": true,
  "balances": [
    {
      "feature_id": "transcription-credits",
      "unlimited": false,
      "balance": 10000
    }
  ]
}
```

In this case, we have a balance of 10,000 credits remaining, so we're allowed to use our `audio-transcription-minutes` feature.

<Note>
  When checking for feature access, if a feature is not defined in the credit
  system (and not in any other product items separately), it will return
  `allowed: false`
</Note>

Now we can send a usage event:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/track" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"customer_id": "user-123",
"feature_id": "audio-transcription-minutes",
"value": 10
}'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

await autumn.track({
  customer_id: "user-123",
  feature_id: "audio-transcription-minutes",
  value: 10,
});
```

</CodeGroup>
```json
{
    "message": "Event recorded successfully",
    "event_id": "event_123",
    "customer_id": "user-123",
    "feature_id": "audio-transcription-minutes"
}
```

In this case, if each `audio-transcription-minute` costs 3 credits, since we sent a usage event for 10 minutes (`value: 10`), it will cost us 30 credits. We started with 10000 credits and our remaining balance will be 9970 credits.

## Monetary credits

You may want your credit system to represent a monetary value: eg, $10 of credits. To implement this, you typically want to treat each credit as 1 cent.

1. When creating your credit system, make sure that you define credit amounts in the per-cent cost <br />
   Eg: if each `audio-transcription-minute` costs 7 cents, our credit amount will be 7.
2. Set any included usage of credits in cents <br />
   Eg, if customers get 5 USD credits for free, they should have an included usage of 500.
3. Set the cost of each credit to 1 cent (0.01) when handling prices

See the credits pricing guide for a more detailed example of setting up a monetary credits system
