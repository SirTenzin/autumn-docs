description: Learn about feature balances for your metered features
---

Each metered feature you create has 3 different fields associated with it per customer. When you get a customer's available features, you will see each of these fields:

1. **Included Usage**: This is the allowance of usage that is included with the product the customer has purchased. This is a fixed value, defined in the product item's `included_usage` field.
   <Note>
     If the product item has a `prepaid` price, the included usage will be
     dynamically set to the quantity of the product item purchased in advance.
   </Note>
2. **Usage**: This is the amount of the feature that the customer has used. It will either be 0 or a positive integer.
3. **Balance**: This is the amount of usage that the customer has remaining. It is typically the difference between the Included Usage and the Usage.

## Getting a Customer's Available Features

You can get a list of acustomer's available features and balances with the `customers` method.

```shell cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.useautumn.com/v1/customers/user_123 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn } from "@useautumn/js";

const autumn = new Autumn({
  apiKey: "am_sk_1234567890",
});

const customer = await autumn.customers.get("user_123");

{
  "features": [
    {
      "feature_id": "ai-messages", //metered feature
      "included_usage": 100,
      "usage": 60,
      "balance": 40,

      "included_usage": 0,

      "balance": -6,
      "unlimited": false,
      "interval": "month",
      "next_reset_at": null
    },
    {
      "feature_id": "premium-support" //boolean feature
    }
  ]
}
```

## Positive and Negative Balances

A feature's balance can either be a negative number or a positive number.

- **Positive Balance**: this represents that the customer has used less than the included usage, and they have some usage remaining.
- **Negative Balance**: this represents that the customer has used more than the included usage, and they have usage that they will be billed for in the next billing period.

<Note>
  Features can only have a negative balance if they have a usage-based price associated with them. This means their product items must be [priced features](/products/product-items#priced-features).

If a feature does not have a price, its balance will never fall below 0 even if more usage events are sent.

</Note>

## Reset Intervals

When you create a product item, you'll define a usage reset interval. When the reset interval comes around, `usage` will be reset to 0, and `balance` will be set back to the `included_usage`.

Reset intervals can be: `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `semi_annual`, or `year`.

If a feature has a price associated with it, the reset interval will be the same as the billing interval. This means it can be one of the following: `month`, `quarter`, `semi_annual`, or `year`.

#### No Reset

Certain features are consumable, and can have balances that are replenished. For example, you may have features like:

- Credits
- AI messages
- Hours of compute

Other features are not consumable, and their usage is continuous. For example:

- Seats
- Workspaces
- Number of compute instances in use

These features should not have a reset interval, so that their balances are never reset.

<Note>
  This is not a hard rule. You may have consumable features like messages, but
  want them to last forever. In this case, they should also have a reset
  interval of “no reset”
</Note>

You can configure a product item to have no reset interval by selecting "No Reset" in the reset interval dropdown via the UI.

If you're creating a [product item via API](/api-reference/products/post):

- If the feature has no price: omit `interval` or set it to `null`
- If the feature has a price: `interval` will be the billing interval, but you can use `item.reset_usage_on_billing: false`

<Info>

**Example use case**

We have a free tier, which gives customers access to 3 seats.
We also have a pro tier, which is charged at $10/seat/month.

For our free tier, we'd create a product item with:

- Usage reset: No Reset
- Via API: `interval: null`

For our pro tier, we'd create a product item with:

- Usage reset: No Reset
- Billing Interval: Month
- Via API: `interval: month`, and `reset_usage_on_billing: false`

</Info>

#### Features with multiple intervals

You may have a pricing model in which a customer can buy the following together:

- a pro plan with 50 credits per month.
- a top-up add-on that grants 100 credits that don't expire

In this case you have a feature that shares two intervals: `month` and "no reset".

Autumn will create 2 separate balances for each of these. You will see each of these in the `customers` route and on the customer details page in the dashboard.

When you send a usage event, Autumn will deduct from the balance with the shortest reset interval first.

<Note>
  If you want to deduct from the balance with the longest reset interval first,
  please contact us.
</Note>

## Edge Cases

There are certain cases in which a feature's balance will diverge from the typical `included_usage` minus `usage` calculation.

#### Setting a feature's balance manually

You can manually edit a users balance via the dashboard or via the API.

<Card
  title="Editing a customer's feature balance"
  href="/customers/managing-customers#editing-feature-balances"
  horizontal
  icon="scale-unbalanced"
/>

When this happens, the balance will be updated to the new value, but the `included_usage` and `usage` will not be updated.

#### Customer has paid for more than they are using

Let's take a pricing model in which a customer pays $10 per seat per month. At the start of the billing period, they are using 5 seats (`balance: -5`, `usage: 5`). Then, they remove a seat.

If `prorate_decrease` is set to `false`, the customer will be paying for 5 seats and using 4 seats (`balance: -5`, `usage: 4`). This means that our customer has 1 seat available that they have paid for but not using.

In this case, the balance and usage has diverged. Autumn accounts for this scenario: they can add another seat at any time, which will not be charged for.

Otherwise, at the start of the next billing period, they usage and balance will synchronize again (`balance: -4`, `usage: 4`), and they will be billed for 4 seats.
