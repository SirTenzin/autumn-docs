title: 'Features'

In Autumn, there are 2 types of features you can create: `boolean` and `metered`. When defining a boolean or metered feature, the `id` you enter is what you'll use to check whether a customer has access later on.

### Configuring a metered feature
For metered features, you need to pass in:

1. One or more event names
2. An aggregation (either `COUNT` or `SUM`)

When calculating the usage of a metered feature, Autumn will first filter all events by `event_name`, and then either `COUNT` or `SUM` over them.

- `COUNT`: This aggregation simply takes the count of events
- `SUM`: This aggregation will sum based on a property you specify as shown below. This property should be passed in the `properties` field when sending an event.

#### Example of sending event with property
In the example below, if there is a metered event `minutes` which sums over the property `length`, then the following event will increment the metered feature by 2.
```js
await fetch('https://api.useautumn.com/v1/events', {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer <token>', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "customer_id": "cus_123",
    "event_name": "minutes",
    "properties": {
      "length": 2
    }
  })
})
```
