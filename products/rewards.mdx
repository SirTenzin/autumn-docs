title: Rewards and Referrals
description: Learn how to use rewards and referrals to incentivize your customers.

Rewards like discounts, usage credits, and free products are a powerful way to improve the likelihood of customers purchasing a product.

You can give these rewards to customers yourselves, and also automatically to customers who refer your product to other users via a referral program.

## Rewards

Autumn's rewards are a enhanced layer over Stripe's coupons. In addition to standard fixed and percentage discounts, with Autumn you can:

- Create promo codes for invoice credits that rollover each billing period <br /> (eg, 500 USD free usage for early adopters)
- Give away free products <br/> (eg 1000 additional AI messages for all users at an event)

You can create a reward from the Autumn dashboard:

1. Navigate to the products page, and click the rewards tab
2. Click "+ Reward"
3. Fill out the fields such as Name, Promo Code, Discount value
4. Select which products it should apply to
5. Click "Create"

#### Invoice credits

You can create promo codes which customers can enter on Stripe's checkout pages for invoice credits. When applied, these codes will grant the customer a monetary amount of "credits" that lasts until they run out.

<Info>
**Example**

You have an AI translation product, that is normally billed at 20 USD per month, plus $1 per 100 words translated.

- For alpha adopters, you want to give away 50 USD of credits to apply across all invoices.
- For beta adopters, you want to give away 50 USD of credits that only applies to the translated words usage-price.

</Info>

To create a code for invoice credits, when creating a reward, select the following:

- Type: fixed discount
- Duration: one off
- Select the option: "Rollover credits to the next invoice"

The promo code you create can either apply across all products (and the entire invoice), or you can select to only apply the invoice credits to specific usage-prices.

#### Free products

You can also give away any [add-on](/products/create-product#add-on-product) product you create to customer with a promo code.

<Info>
**Example**

If a customer has access to 50 AI messages per month, they can redeem a code for a free booster pack of additional 100 messages per month.

</Info>

To create a free product, under reward `type`, select "Free Product". Then choose the add-on product from the selector. You must have at least 1 add-on product created before doing this.

<Warning>
  Free product promo codes cannot be redeemed through Stripe's checkout page.
  You should use the redeem endpoint.
</Warning>

## Referral Programs

Referral programs allow you to automatically grant rewards to customers who bring on new customers. You can define the referral program in the Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the products page, and click the rewards tab
2. Click "+ Referral Program"
3. Give the program an ID (you'll use this to refer to it in the API), and select a reward (see above) to be given away
4. Decide whether the reward should be granted when the new customer signs up, or when the purchase a product
5. Specify a max redemption number (a limit number of times one customer can be rewarded for referring another customer)
6. Decide whether this reward should be granted to the referrer only, or both the referrer and the redeemer (new customer)

You can then implement the referral program from your application with just 2 routes. First, generate a referral code for the customer making the referral.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.useautumn.com/v1/referrals/code \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "customer_id": "user_123",
  "program_id": "free-month"
}'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn } from "@useautumn/js";
const autumn = new Autumn();

const referral = autumn.getReferralCode({
  customer_id: "user_123",
  program_id: "free-month",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "code": "4EXWV1",
  "customer_id": "user_123",
  "created_at": 1744797427206
}
```

Then, from the new customer, redeem the referral code from your application.

<CodeGroup>
```shell cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.useautumn.com/v1/referrals/redeem \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "code": "<string>",
  "customer_id": "<string>"
}'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn } from "@useautumn/js";
const autumn = new Autumn();

const redeem = autumn.redeem({
  code: "4EXWV1",
  customer_id: "new_user_123",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "id": "rr_2vo3Jt9oqF6XgAlWI1MjYktv4dB",
  "customer_id": "new_user_123",
  "applied": false,
  "reward_id": "free-month"
}
```

The reward will automatically apply on the event that you set (customer creation or product purchase). Whether the reward has been applied is marked by the `applied` field in the response.

In the customer details page, you'll be able to see which customers have made referrals and been referred.
