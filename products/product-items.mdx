Product items are the building blocks of your products. Each item defines what customers are allowed to use when they purchase the product, and how they should be charged for it.

There are 3 types of product items: Features, Prices and Priced Features.

## Features

Features are the parts of a product that your users get access to when they enable a product. You can model these as either metered or boolean.

#### Metered features

These are any features that require you to keep track of a usage count, and defined with 2 key fields.

- **Included Usage**: how much of this feature should be included with this product
- **Reset Interval**: whether the usage count should reset back to the included amount on a periodic basis, and if so how often.

<Info>
**Example**

You have an AI chatbot that allows users to send 10 messages per month. Included Usage is `10` and Reset Interval is `per month`.

You also have a 3 seat limit per organization. For this, Included Usage is `3` and Reset Interval is `No Reset`.

</Info>

With these two fields defined, Autumn can track what your users have access to and enforce these limits. From your application:

- [Check if a user](/features/entitled) is allowed to access a feature (because they have included usage remaining)
- [Send a usage event](/features/recording-usage) so Autumn can keep track of the balance

You can learn more about how Autumn handles metered balances, usage and reset intervals on the Balances page.

#### Boolean features

Boolean features are for your features that can be either enabled or disabled. Think of them like feature flags to gate specific parts of your application based on what product a user has (eg, access to a premium analytics dashboard).

For these features, there is no configuration needed to be set. If you add them to a product, users on that product will be granted [access to the feature](/features/entitled#checking-boolean-features).

## Prices

Prices are a fixed amount a user will be charged for a product. They can be either a one-time payment or a recurring payment.

- **One-time**: a one-time payment for a product. Useful for things like add-ons, top-ups or onboarding fees. <br />
  Eg: $10 top-up to get 100 AI chatbot messages
- **Subscriptions**: a fixed amount a user will be charged for a product per unit of time.
  Eg: $10 per month for an AI chatbot Pro tier

You can select whether to create a one-time or subscription price through the "Billing Interval" dropdown.

## Priced Features

Priced features can be used to model usage-based pricing, where the price of the product is variable and tied to how much of a feature a user consumes. This combines the configuration options of a feature with a price.

- **Included Usage**: how much of this feature should be included for free
- **Reset Interval**: choose whether the usage count should reset when the feature is billed
- **Price**: the price of the feature per billing units of usage, or tiered by usage
- **Billing Units**: the packages of units that the price is defined for (eg, $5 for 1000 credits)
- **Billing Interval**: how often the price is applied (eg, one-time, monthly, annually)
- **Prepaid**: whether to charge for a fixed quantity of the feature upfront (pay-per-use at the end of period)

<Note>

When creating priced feature items via API, the `interval` field is the
billing interval.

You can use the `reset_usage_when_billing` flag to control
whether the usage count should reset when the feature is billed (eg, for
credits, API calls and other consumable resources), or not reset (eg, for
seats, workspaces etc).

</Note>

<Note>Features with one-time prices cannot have a reset interval.</Note>

You can use priced features to model a number of different pricing models:

- **Prepaid credits**: prepaying for a fixed quantity of credits
- **Seat-based pricing**: paying for a number of seats in-use per month
- **Overage pricing**: free usage included, and pay for usage beyond that
- **Full usage-based pricing**: pay-per-use for every unit of usage
- **Tiered pricing**: pay different amounts for different units of usage
